## Hello students!

You can find the solutions to lab for unit 2 above. I found a few typos so you may want to check the solutions if you are getting stuck.

_note that if you want to download the solutions one way is to right-click on the raw button and then save target as etc._ (for PCs)

I will post more scripts and files here over the course of the workshop so stay tuned!
